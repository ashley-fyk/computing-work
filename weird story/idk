**doom**

     Where am I? How long... have I been in here for? As I opened my eyes slowly, struggling to adjust to the darkness, millions of unsettling thoughts crossed my mind. 
  I rubbed my eyes with unnecessary force, and squinted at the eerie surrounding. I could not find anyone else. I was _alone._ I shivered. I started, "Hello! Is anyone ther-" BAM. 
  I tried to turn around, forgetting that my hands and legs were tied tightly to the chair. I felt a chilly finger brush my neck. A cold chill ran down my spine. 
  I spun around with my heart in my mouth, just to see Ms Huang breathing down my neck, screaming at me. "WHERE.IS.YOUR.HOMEWORK?!?!?"
  "AHHHHHHHH!" I woke up with a start and screamed.
  Cold sweat dripped from my forehead, as I realized that it was all a dream. I heaved a sigh of relief, and looked at the clock beside me. 
  _Still early, I should go back to sleep,_ I thought to myself, before getting into a comfortable position once again and drifted off to a deep sleep.
  
  
    "Don't move an inch. Or else..." I opened my eyes, and to my horror, a knife was right under my nose, touching my neck. I looked up and saw Mr large with a smirk on his face. 
  The world was spinning as I stared ahead, not knowing what to do. I saw my classmates gaping at me, some covering their eyes and others covering their ears. "Remember, everyone! 
  If you continue to misbehave, you will end up like him..." I felt a kick and I was on the floor the next instance. I groaned. Once again, the knife touched my neck. 
  This time, however, went right through my neck without warning. Pain shot through my entire body and I blacked out. Fresh, bright red blood started streaming down my body.
